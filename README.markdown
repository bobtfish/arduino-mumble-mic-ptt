# Arduino mumble mic

We use [http://mumble.sourceforge.net/][Mumble] quite a lot at work.

However the level detection isn't optimum, meaning that typing
creeps onto the channel etc.

Ergo most people switched to using PTT (push to talk).

However people often forget to push when they want to talk, and I
personally hate headsets with microphones.

So I bought a CB mic or two, took them apart, and wired them up to
an arduino to translate the switch on the mic to a USB key-press.
